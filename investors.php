                    Normal investors invest alongside lead investors. They are generally first time investors who are new to angel investing, and it is thereby safe for these investors to invest along side active angels. Once the valuation is determined by the lead investor, other investors put in their contributions proportionate to the amount of equity they'd like to buy in the business. Please note that renegotiation of terms is not possible with normal investors.

                   Companies Act 2013 states that a private limited company in India cannot raise funds from more than 200 shareholders in one financial year - this means that many a times, company's promoters might keep a <b>minimum</b> contribution limit for the investor's name to be counted in for the shareholder's certificate. Normal investors can also ask for a board member seat(s) in the company (if applicable) depending on their investment size.

      <p>Nominees are people who would like to participate in a fund raise process but their individual contributions are not big enough to secure their name in the company's shareholder's certificate post fundraising round. FundMyVenture acts as a nominee to such investments by becoming a shareholder itself in the company raising funds. Please note that FundMyVenture does NOT act as a mutual fund here - we don't invest money as per our discretion but rather invest money on behalf of investors who show interest in investing in a particular company. In return, we keep investors (who have opted to invest as nominees) updated about regular developments (milestones achieved, revenue number, growth numbers) of the company.</p>
